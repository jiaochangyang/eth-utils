# Hashing Utilities

Simple cli wrapper around sha library to provide an offline hashing tool. Primarily built to suit my own needs and to play around with Rust. Currently supports for keccak256 and sha3_256. If the tool is in your PATH, use by

```
hashutils <keccak256 | sha3_256> <input-string>
```
